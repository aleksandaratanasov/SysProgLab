SysProgLab
==========

Compiler for a very basic programming language - assignment in SysProg lab.

Interpreter requires the libsysprogSS2011.so file to be exported:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:[path to library]

Run the interpreter via following command:
java -jar interpreter.jar

Note
===========
The compiler produces code that can only be run by the interpreter's version uploaded here (summer term 2011)


TODO
===========
1) Check the & operator
2) Put parser's node classes in separate files like before to make the parser code more readable
